# Calico AI — Instagram Outbound Process

## Overview

Automated Instagram DM outreach to ecommerce photographer-owners and related product photography studios/media companies. The agent works city by city, scraping Instagram search results, qualifying profiles, checking for prior contact, selecting the best-fit message, sending the DM, and logging everything to a CSV tracker.

---

## Inputs Required

| Input | Example | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **City** | `Kansas City` | Used to construct search queries |
| **Hashtag / search query** | `#ecommercephotography #productphotography #kansascityphotographer` | Agent constructs this from city + niche |

---

## Search Query Construction

Base URL:
```
https://www.instagram.com/explore/search/keyword/?q=<query>
```

Query strategy — combine niche + city signal:
- Primary: `#ecommercephotography`, `#productphotography` + city name variations
- Secondary: `#[city]photographer`, `#[city]productphotographer`, `#[city]studiophotography`
- Fallback: `ecommerce product photography [city]`

Example for Kansas City:
```
https://www.instagram.com/explore/search/keyword/?q=%23ecommercephotographykansascity
https://www.instagram.com/explore/search/keyword/?q=%23kansascityproductphotographer
https://www.instagram.com/explore/search/keyword/?q=%23kansascityphotographer
```

Collect unique post URLs from the search results page. Extract profile handles from each post before visiting individual profiles.

---

## Per-Profile Workflow

For each profile found in search results, execute this sequence in order:

### Step 1 — Early exit: check the CSV tracker

Before loading the profile, look up the username in `outreach-log.csv`.

- If a row exists with that username → **skip**, move to next profile
- If no row → continue to Step 2

This avoids loading a profile page we've already processed.

### Step 2 — Load the profile and qualify

Navigate to `https://www.instagram.com/<username>/`

Read the profile:
- Bio text
- Account name / handle
- Recent post captions and hashtags
- Follower count / following count
- Any business category label Instagram shows

**Qualification criteria** (based on `calico-ai-customer-research.md`):

| Signal | Qualifies | Does Not Qualify |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Bio mentions ecommerce, product, Amazon/Shopify, brand/catalog, PDP, studio product photography | ✅ | General lifestyle, portrait, wedding only (unless clearly also product) |
| Posts show product-on-white, lifestyle product, catalog, brand shoots | ✅ | No product or ecommerce-related content visible |
| Account type | Solo photographer-owner, small product studio, creative/media company serving brands | Unrelated retail brand account (not a photography service), unrelated business |
| Follower range | 200 – 50,000 | <200 (likely inactive) or >100K (likely brand account) |
| Location signal | Target city or nearby market | Clearly different market with no overlap |
| Activity | Posted within last 90 days | Dormant account |

**ICP segment to assign** (feeds Step 5):
- `solo` — solo ecommerce photographer-owner (freelance product/catalog shooter)
- `studio` — small ecommerce/product photography studio (2-5 people, photographer-owner led)
- `media_company` — product or ecommerce media company (team, bundled photo/video for brands)

If the profile does **not** qualify:
- Log a row to `outreach-log.csv` with `status = disqualified` and `disqualify_reason`
- Move to next profile

### Step 3 — Check Instagram DM inbox for prior contact

Navigate to the Instagram DM inbox (`https://www.instagram.com/direct/inbox/`) and search for the username.

- If a conversation exists → **skip**, log `status = already_contacted`, move to next profile
- If no conversation → continue to Step 4

This is the authoritative check. The CSV is a local cache; the inbox is the source of truth.

### Step 4 — Select the best-fit message

Use the ICP segment from Step 2 and the offer mapping table from `calico-ai-offer-constructs.md`:

| ICP Segment | Primary Offer | Script to Use |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| `solo` | Offer 1: "The $300 You're Not Charging" | Blitz Script 1 or targeted Version A/B |
| `studio` | Offer 2: "Add Video to Your Menu This Week" | Blitz Script 1 or Offer 2 Version A/B |
| `media_company` | Offer 4: "Scale Without Hiring" | Blitz Script 3 or Offer 4 Version A/B |

Secondary signals that override offer selection:
- Profile posts show heavy editing work → layer in Offer 3 (editing pain angle)
- Profile bio or location mentions NY or CA → open with Offer 6 (compliance angle)
- Profile has drone/video content already → use Offer 4 or 5 (scale or enterprise-brand angle)

Replace `{{first_name}}` with the first name from the profile name field, or the handle if name is not available.

### Step 5 — Send the DM

Navigate to the profile and open a new DM conversation.

Send the selected message exactly as written (with `{{first_name}}` substituted).

Verify the message was sent by confirming it appears in the conversation thread.

### Step 6 — Log to CSV

Append a row to `outreach-log.csv` with:

| Column | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 datetime, e.g. `2026-04-27T14:32:00` |
| `username` | Instagram handle (no @) |
| `profile_name` | Display name from profile |
| `icp_segment` | `solo`, `studio`, or `media_company` |
| `offer_used` | Offer number and name, e.g. `Offer 1 - The $300 You're Not Charging` |
| `message_sent` | Full text of the message sent |
| `status` | `sent`, `disqualified`, `already_contacted`, or `error` |
| `disqualify_reason` | If disqualified, brief reason; else empty |
| `city` | Target city for this run |

### Step 7 — Wait, then continue

Wait a **randomized delay of 8–25 minutes** before processing the next profile.

This mimics human pacing and reduces the risk of rate limiting or account flags.

## CSV Tracker

**File:** `outreach-log.csv`  
**Location:** Project root — `outreach-log.csv` beside this repo (path depends on your machine; clone folder recommended name: `ecommerce-photographer-ig-outbound`).

**Schema:**
```
timestamp,username,profile_name,icp_segment,offer_used,message_sent,status,disqualify_reason,city
```

If the file does not exist, create it with the header row before writing the first entry.

---

## Full Loop Pseudocode

```
configure(city)
queries = build_search_queries(city)

for query in queries:
    profiles = scrape_instagram_search(query)
    
    for username in profiles:
        # Step 1 — fast exit
        if username in csv_tracker:
            continue
        
        # Step 2 — load and qualify
        profile = load_instagram_profile(username)
        icp_segment = qualify_profile(profile)
        
        if not icp_segment:
            log_csv(username, status="disqualified", ...)
            continue
        
        # Step 3 — check inbox
        if conversation_exists_in_inbox(username):
            log_csv(username, status="already_contacted", ...)
            continue
        
        # Step 4 — pick message
        message = select_message(icp_segment, profile)
        
        # Step 5 — send DM
        send_dm(username, message)
        
        # Step 6 — log
        log_csv(username, status="sent", message=message, ...)
        
        # Step 7 — wait
        sleep(random(8, 25) minutes)
```

## Safety and Rate Limiting Notes

- **Do not send more than ~20-30 DMs per session.** Instagram flags accounts for high-volume identical messages.
- **Vary message wording slightly** between sends where possible — use alternate script versions (A vs. B).
- **Stop immediately** if Instagram shows a "Try Again Later" or "Action Blocked" notice. Log the blocked state and surface it.
- **Never send to the same username twice.** The CSV check in Step 1 and the inbox check in Step 3 are both guards.
- If the Instagram session appears logged out or access-restricted, stop and ask the user to re-authenticate before continuing.
